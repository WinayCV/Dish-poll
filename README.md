## About

The application aims to rank dishes based on user preferences, assigning them positions in ranks 1, 2, or 3. These ranks correspond to different point values, where rank 1 holds 30 points, rank 2 carries 20 points, and rank 3 corresponds to 10 points.

Users can interact with the dishes and assign their preferences, which are then reflected in the ranking tab. Additionally, users have the ability to view and manage their choices within the dashboard.
